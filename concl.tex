\section{Conclusion}

In order to mitigate the memory pressure in current data processing systems deployed as the services, we analyze the memory usage of various function APIs enclosed in these systems, and build four coarse-grained models to classify the function APIs. Further, we propose to use the memory usage rate as a uniform criteria to measure the impact of a task on memory pressure. In this paper, we develop a scheduler called MURS, which is based on the memory usage rate. MURS can suspend the tasks that cause heave memory pressure, and speed up the tasks with light memory pressure. MURS can be implemented in most data processing systems. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that Comparing with Spark, MURS can reduce the execution time of tasks by up to 65.8\%, mitigate the memory pressure by up to 81\% and avoid the task spill by approximately 90\%.
